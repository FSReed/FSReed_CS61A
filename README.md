Actually this is my first time to create a repo and take care of it like it's my baby lol.  
Big thanks to UCB CS 61A, which gives me the opportunity to dive into the world of CS.  
This is much more like a repo to record my progress, so all these texts seem to be written just for me myself lol.  
If someday later I can see these words again, hope I have been doing what I want to do at that time.  
That's all! At least for now!
